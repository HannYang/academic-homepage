    Hi there, this is Gabija H.Yang from Guangdong, China. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Guangzhou, expected to graduate in June 2025.
    
    大家好，这是来自中国广东的杨涵。目前，我在广东省广州市读硕士研究生，预计于2025年6月完成硕士学业。
    从2022年至今，我在南方医科大学南方医院整形外科，跟随鲁峰教授学习。lu‘s lab是中国最早成立的脂肪医学团队，在这里我主要的研究方向是借助脂肪脱细胞细胞外基质，探索天然生物材料的体内血管化机制。
    我的工作涉及脱细胞细胞外基质的制备、动物移植模型的构建、基质的原位追踪，以及组织病理学评估、胶原的单纤维分析等，以开拓由筋膜介导的生物材料血管化领域，旨在克服与血管化相关的生物材料组织再生难题
  </p>
    Since 2022, I’ve been studying under Professor Lu Feng at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. 
    Lu’s lab is one of the earliest adipose medicine teams in China. My research focuses on using adipose acellular matrix (AAM) to explore 
    vascularization mechanisms in natural biomaterials, particularly fascia-mediated biomaterial vascularization. My work includes acellular matrix preparation, 
    animal model construction, in situ matrix tracing, histological evaluation, and collagen fiber analysis, aiming to address tissue regeneration challenges related to vascularization.
