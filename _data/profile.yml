    Hi there, this is Gabija H.Yang from Guangdong, China. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Guangzhou, expected to graduate in June 2025.
  </p>
    Since 2022, I’ve been studying under Professor Lu Feng at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. 
    Lu’s lab is one of the earliest adipose medicine teams in China. My research focuses on using adipose acellular matrix (AAM) to explore 
    vascularization mechanisms in natural biomaterials, particularly fascia-mediated biomaterial vascularization. My work includes acellular matrix preparation, 
    animal model construction, in situ matrix tracing, histological evaluation, and collagen fiber analysis, aiming to address tissue regeneration challenges related to vascularization.
